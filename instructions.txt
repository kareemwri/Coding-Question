*Data*

Attached is a dataset of car fuel economy data. It comes from https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml.

The particular file is https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/epadata/vehicles.csv.zip "Datasets for All Model Years (1984–2019)”

The data dictionary is here: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml#vehicle

*Question*

1. Which manufacturer produces the most fuel efficient fleet of cars?

2. Build a model to predict city mpg (variable “UCity” in column BG).

3. How has fuel economy changed over time? Are there any other interesting insights or trends?


As well as a complete model for UCity with code, we are looking for a coherent data-story that examines UCity 
as well one or more aspects of the data such as the evolution of a car manufacturer(s), engine types, future mpg. 
It is up to you. This is a deliberately open-ended question that provides a chance to showcase your EDA, analysis, and presentation skills.

The expectations is that you should spend no more than 3-4 hours on this task.

*Format*
We are willing to accept a variety for formats---most people submit a Jupyter notebook---but
we do want to see your code and we do want to see the plots and charts you used or wish to present.
Note the use of "data-story" above.

Therefore, please don't require the hiring manager to install packages or run code to see 
the output you want us to see. That is, please submit one or more self-contained files (such 
as Jupyter notebook, HTML webpage, PDF, Python source files only if accompanied with some other 
docs to show the plots and commentary) that the hiring manager can simply open and read your work.

Good luck!
